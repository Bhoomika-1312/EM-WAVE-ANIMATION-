üì° Electromagnetic Wave Simulation

This project simulates electromagnetic wave propagation in 3D space using Python and Matplotlib. It provides visualizations of electric and magnetic field components, wave vectors, and related parameters. This is helpful for students and researchers to understand the behavior of EM waves in various media.

üöÄ Features

-Simulation of electric field components (Ex, Ey, Ez)
-Calculation of magnetic field components (Hx, Hy, Hz) from Maxwell‚Äôs equations
-Visualization of wave propagation over time
-Adjustable parameters such as frequency, wave vector (k), refractive index, and relative permittivity
-Smooth 2D/3D animations of wave behavior
-Support for analyzing polarization (linear, circular, elliptical)

‚öôÔ∏è Parameters Calculated
-Free-space wavelength
-Wavelength in the medium
-Refractive index
-Relative permittivity
-Wave vector components (Kx, Ky, Kz)
-Electric field components (Ex, Ey, Ez)
-Magnetic field components (Hx, Hy, Hz)
-By plotting E‚Çì vs E·µß (or observing the motion of the tip of the E-field vector):
  Linear Polarization ‚Üí Electric field oscillates in one fixed plane.
  Circular Polarization ‚Üí The tip of the electric field vector traces a circle (E‚Çì and E·µß equal in amplitude, 90¬∞ phase difference).
  Elliptical Polarization ‚Üí The tip traces an ellipse (different amplitudes and/or non-90¬∞ phase difference).

By changing amplitudes and phase differences between E‚Çì and E·µß, the animation dynamically shows these polarization types.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-Python 3.x
-NumPy for numerical computations
-Matplotlib for plotting and animation
-IPython/ Jupyter Notebook for interactive simulation
